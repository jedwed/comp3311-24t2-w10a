R(A, B, C, D)
F = {C → D,   C → A,   B → C}

a. Candidate keys of table R
B+ = {B, C, D, A} -> B is a candidate key
C+ = {C, D, A} -> C is not a candidate key

B is the candidate key

b. Is relation R in BCNF

- C -> D
1. C -> D not trivial
2. C is not a superkey
C -> D violates condition for functional dependency

Hence schema is not in BCNF.

c. Is relation R in 3NF
Left as an exercise to the reader
