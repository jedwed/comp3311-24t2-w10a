a. What functional dependencies are implied 
if we know that a set of attributes X is a primary key for a relation R?

We can imply X determines all attributes of relation R

b. What functional dependencies can we infer do not hold by inspection 
of the following relation?

| A   | B   | C   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a   | 1   | x   |
| b   | 2   | y   |
| c   | 1   | z   |
| d   | 2   | x   |
| a   | 1   | y   |
| b   | 2   | z   |


c. Suppose that we have a relation schema R(A,B,C) 
representing a relationship between two entity sets E and F with keys A and B respectively, 
and suppose that R has (at least) the functional dependencies A → B and B → A. 
Explain what this tells us about the relationship between E and F.

- Entity E with primary key A
- Entity F with primary key B

- A -> B, B -> A

Question: relationship between entity sets E and F
The relationship between E and F is a one-to-one relationship
