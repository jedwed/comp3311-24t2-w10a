Consider the schema R and set of fds F

R  =  ABCDEFGH
F  =  { ABH → C,  A → DE,  BGH → F,  F → ADH,  BH → GE }

Produce a BCNF decomposition of R.

Candidate key 
- BH+ = {B, H, G, E, F, A, D, C}

1. Consider if table R is in BCNF
ABH -> C
1. Not trivial
2. ABH is a superkey

A -> DE
1. Not trivial
2. Not a superkey

Decompose R into
R1 = ADE
R2 = ABCFGH

2. Consider if ADE is in BCNF

3. Consider if ABCFGH is in BCNF
