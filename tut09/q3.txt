Consider the relation R(A,B,C,D,E) and the  
set of functional dependencies 
F = { A → B, BC → E, ED → A }

a. List all of the candidate keys for R.
- The candidate key(s) have an attribute closure including all attributes of R

!Tip: If an attribute doesn't exist in the RHS of any fds: it has to be in the candidate key

- ACD+ + {A, C, D, B, E}: ACD is a candidate key
- BCD+ = {C, D, B, E, A}: BCD is a candidate key
- CDE+ = {C, D, E, A, B}: CDE is also candidate key

ACDE is a superkey but NOT a candidate key (not minimal)















X -> X
XY -> X



R(A,B,C,D,E)
F = {A -> B, BC -> E, ED -> A}
Candidate keys: BCD and CDE and ACD
b. Is R in third normal form (3NF)?

Loop through all functional dependencies

- A -> B 
1. A -> B is not trivial X
2. A is not a superkey X
3. B is part of candidate key BCD

Functional dependency meets requirements for 3NF but Not BCNF

- BC -> E
1. BC -> E is not trivial X
2. BC is not a superkey X
3. E is part of candidate key CDE

Functional dependency meets requirements for 3NF but not BCNF

- ED -> A
1. ED -> A Not trivial
2. ED not a superkey
3. A is part of candidate key ACD

Functional dependency meets requirements for 3NF

Hence, schema is in 3NF but not in BCNF
















c. Is R in Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)?
