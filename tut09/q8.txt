Attributes
acct# - unique account indentifier

Unnormalised relation R(acct#, branch#, tfn, kind, balance, city, name)

Each account is held at a specific branch, 
but a customer may hold more than one account 
and an account may have more than one associated customer.

Q: Normalise the relation into 3NF
- tfn -> name
- acct# -> balance, kind, branch#
- branch# -> city

candidate key: tfn, acct#

Q: Decompose into 3NF
1. Minimal cover: we already have the minimal cover
2. 
Customer(tfn, name)
Account(acct#, balance, kind, branch#)
Branch(branch#, city)

3.
Because candidate key tfn, acct# is not in any of the tables
Owns(tfn, acct#)
