b.
T1 W(X)      R(Y)
T2      R(Y)      R(X)

Determine if its conflict serializable and/or view serializable

First determine if it's conflict serializable
Precedence graph
T1 -> T2
No cycles
Hence, conflict serializable and also view serializable

e.
T1 R(X)      W(X)
T2      W(X)
T3                W(X)

Determine if its conflict serializable and/or view serializable
First determine if it's conflict serializable
Precedence graph
T1 -> T2 (T1 R(X) before T2 W(X))
T2 -> T1 (T2 W(X) before T1 W(X))
A cycle! Hence its not conflict serializable

Now check view serializability
Compare to serial schedule T1 -> T2 -> T3
T1 R(X) W(X)
T2           W(X)
T3                W(X)

In the given schedule and the serial schedule, T1 reads to X first
In the given schedule and the serial schedule, T3 writes to X last
Hence, schedule is view serializable
