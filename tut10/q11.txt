T1:      R(A) W(Z)                
T2:                R(B) W(Y)        
T3: W(A)                     W(B) 

a. Draw a precedence graph
T3 -> T1 (T3 W(A) before T1 R(A))
T2 -> T3 (T2 R(B) before T3 W(B))
Precedence graph: T2 -> T3 -> T1
No cycles in precedence graph, schedule is conflict serializable
